# Result-Management-System
Project to create a portal to access the acedemic records of students by students as well as administrators.

Admin controls feature facilities such as adding new students to the record, adding marks of various subjects, modifying marks and viewing the result and details of all the students. Admin controls are accessed by providing and verifying a Username and Password.

Students can access their acedemic report by providing their Roll No.

This is accomplished by storing student details, academic details and admin credentials in a mysql database rms. Java swing is used to create UI.
